## 📋 Project Overview

This project uses behavioral and demographic data to segment a customer base. By classifying customers into distinct groups—such as 'High Spenders' or 'At-Risk Loyalists'—the analysis provides immediate, actionable recommendations for sales and marketing teams.

The analysis is structured around these key strategic questions:
* Which demographic profiles correspond to the **highest spending scores**?
* How do **product category preferences** vary across different income and loyalty segments?
* Which groups should be prioritized for **retention efforts**?

## 💡 Key Insights & Recommendations

The segmentation analysis yielded several strategic findings:

* **High-Value Profile:** The **high-spending, long-term members** consistently prefer high-margin categories like **Electronics and Clothing**. These segments should receive exclusive early-access and loyalty rewards.
* **Opportunity Segment:** **Male customers** showed higher purchase frequency. This group is **high-potential** and should be targeted with introductory offers to increase visit frequency.
* **Behavioral Clusters:** Distinct clusters were visually confirmed, indicating that income level strongly dictates both **spending score** and **preferred shopping categories**. This validates a segment-based approach over a mass-market approach.
